# Language-Modeling
Deep Learning Assignment2

This Assigment is work on a neural network for character-level language modeling with the Shakespeare dataset. The language model you will build is a sort of "many-to-many" recurrent neural networks.  
This repository includes dataset.py, model.py, main.py, README.md and result_file.
